# How you will build your rig

You will:

* Buy gear
* While you wait for your gear, set up (or update your) Nightscout to be ready for OpenAPS; plus read up on how OpenAPS works.
* When you get your gear, put together your rig, run a script, and provide the information needed so OpenAPS can communicate with YOUR diabetes devices.
* Start looping!

Over time, you may also choose to enable advanced features or update your rig, as more features and algorithm improvements become available. You should make sure to stay plugged in to key channels (like openaps-dev google group; Looped on Facebook; and on Twitter by following @OpenAPS) so you can be aware when updates become available. You should also make sure to tell us when you’ve closed your loop, which includes notes on how to join the safety-critical announcement list in case we need to alert you to any safety-related changes or updates.

## What you’ll see in this guide

* Wherever you see text that is formatted `like this`, it is a code snippet. You should copy and paste instead of attempting to type this out; this will save you debugging time for finding your typos.* Wherever there are `<bracketed_components>`, these are meant for you to insert your own information. Most of the time, it doesn't matter what you choose **as long as you stay consistent throughout this guide**. That means if you choose `myopenaps` as your  `<myopenaps>` directory, you must use `myopenaps` every time you see `<myopenaps>`. Choose carefully when naming things so it’s easy to remember. Do not include the `< >` brackets in your name.
