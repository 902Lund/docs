# Get Ready

The OpenAPS setup process can be broken up into several parts:

* Acquiring the hardware and information you'll need to build your OpenAPS system
* Testing your pump and settings
* Preparing your Edison (installing jubilinux, wifi networks, and other information)
* Setting up Nightscout
* Building your loop
* Adding in your personal preferences and features

As with all things new, there is a little bit of a learning curve to building your first OpenAPS rig.  Read slowly, double-check your spelling and make sure you don't skip steps.  If you get stuck or are unsure, you can use the screenshots to compare how the resulting screens should look.  You can also post to Gitter or Facebook to ask for specific if you find yourself stuck.
